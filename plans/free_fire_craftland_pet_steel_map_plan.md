# Free Fire Craftland Map Plan: Pet Steel Style

## Overview
This plan outlines the design for a Free Fire Craftland map themed around "Pet Steel" - featuring steel structures and integrated pet elements. The map combines industrial steel aesthetics with cute pet animals to create a unique gameplay environment.

## Theme and Core Concept
- **Theme**: Industrial steel city with domesticated pets
- **Core Concept**: A futuristic pet sanctuary built entirely from steel, where players navigate through metallic structures while interacting with various animals
- **Visual Style**: Predominantly steel/metal blocks with occasional colorful accents for pet areas
- **Atmosphere**: Mix of industrial harshness and pet-friendly warmth

## Map Requirements (Based on Craftland Standards)
- **Size**: 150x150 blocks (standard large map)
- **Height Limit**: 50 blocks maximum
- **Block Types**: Focus on steel, iron, and metal variants; limited use of wood/stone for contrast
- **Animals**: Static decorative pets (dogs, cats, birds, etc.)
- **Interactive Elements**: Pressure plates, doors, basic traps
- **Spawn Points**: Multiple fair spawn locations
- **Objectives**: Custom objectives involving pet rescue and steel collection
